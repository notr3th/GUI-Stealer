## Getting Started
### Install
Download [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/) and open the emulator

Download [Codex](https://codex.lol/android) on the emulator and pick the roblox game you want to steal the gui from

### Extracting gui
Execute the code with codex
```lua
Configuration = {
    Savetofile = true,
    Copytoclipboard = false,
    Print = false
}

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notr3th/GUI-Stealer/main/loader.lua"))()
```
> I recommend you only use savetofile

## Converting it to studio
Download [GUI Stealer plugin]([https://github.com/notr3th](https://github.com/notr3th/GUI-Stealer/blob/main/Plugin.lua)) (not finished yet)

Open roblox studio and put the plugin in your plugins folder

Restart roblox studio and make sure to open the plugin

Paste the extracted code into the text box and press import

## The plugin is still work in progress but i will finish it very soon
